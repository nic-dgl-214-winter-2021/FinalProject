HomeBody V1

This project aims to mimic the features of a modern fitness app targetted specifically at users who have been effected by the coronavirus and therefore must do their part to stay active at home. Homebody was created as it was a trending topic at the time of conception, and i had felt as if this app offered an equal amount of opportunity as it did simplicity for the technologies i could incorporate.

this app features AVKIT, FireBase & EventKit. eaching add a modern feature to the app to allow for a more pleasant user experience and potentially a paid model in a world where this app would actually launch.
